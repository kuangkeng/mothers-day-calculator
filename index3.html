  The glamorous life of a mom who also is the primary housekeeper is filled with picking up dirty socks, sweeping up spilled Cheerios, vacuuming the dog hair from under the couch, washing the dishes -- all while dodging Legos strewn about the carpet. Being responsible for housecleaning and maintenance is a job equivalent to $10.98 an hour as a janitor. But you can’t replace everything a mom does around the house by hiring a <a href="https://www.handy.com/">Handy Cleaner</a> for a few hours (though that would still be a nice idea for a <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/mothers-day-2015-gift-guide-ideas-10-beauty-products-mom-will-love-1901736">Mother’s Day Gift</a>. Mothers don’t just scrub toilets and make the beds -- they keep everything in its place.

  Services like FreshDirect and <a href="https://www.blueapron.com/">Blue Apron<a> may have made feeding a family easier, but it’s still a time-consuming actiivity. Kids are picky eaters -- one might want peanut butter first, then the jelly, another might want crunchy peanut butter, not smooth, and another might be allergic to peanuts. Keeping tabs on who likes what, who is hungry when and who ate a big snack after school so they aren’t hungry for dinner is a Sudoku puzzle that can’t be replaced with even the best meal delivery service. Not to mention quantity -- have you ever seen a growing teenager eat? The actual hours spent cooking are only the last step to being a chef, a job which can earn to $20.01 an hour.

  Michelle Obama may want everyone to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/15/michelle-obama-garden-planting_n_7074040.html">plant a vegetable garden</a>, and sure, that’s an educational and fun way to spend an afternoon. But it’s also dirty and time-consuming. Your preschooler isn’t going to remember to water those carrots. Gardening is a great hobby, but, like anything that requires picking up after pets and regular maintenance, it’s hard work. And work that would pay an average of $11.68 an hour.

Despite the washing machine and dryer being there for anyone to use, it often falls to the mom to take care of laundry. Between separating colors, picking up the dry cleaning and making sure the right soccer uniform is ready for the game, a mom must also be on 24/7 stain removal duty. Keeping the family cleaned and pressed is equivalent to $9.77 an hour as a laundry and dry cleaning worker.

A mother’s economic duties go beyond allowances and budgeting for vacations (remember that time last month when you were up to your neck in tax season?). For many women, balancing the books, knowing how much the family can spend on vacations and Christmas presents, and taking care of the family’s financial investments are all just another part of the day. However, paying for a financial manager would cost $55.44 an hour.

We almost didn’t include this category since spending time with your children is a perk of being a mother, not a duty. But if our society is willing to pay baby sitters and nannies to hang out with our children, maybe we should be paying mothers the equivalent of $9.48 an hour.

Sometimes, especially during those sullen teenage years, children think they’re too cool to tell their parents what they’re up to. It can take 45 minutes for teens to answer the question “What did you do at school today” in between their constant Snapchatting and YikYakking. But just because they aren’t telling you what they’re up to doesn’t mean they’re not telling Ask.fm. Sometimes a mom just needs to don her hacker hat and be private investigator (a job that pays $21.43 an hour, by the way). Just don’t comment on their Facebook posts -- that would be embarrassing!

For six hours or so a day your children sit in classrooms learning everything the American educational system can throw at them. And then they come home and ask for your help with a math concept you haven’t thought of since the fourth grade. Being a mom with school-age children means checking homework, tracking grades, meeting with teachers and counselors, spending hours watching <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> videos, editing college application essays, churning through SAT vocabulary flashcards and forcing your kids to go to summer school. All of which is equivalent to being a teacher earning a wage of $14.62 an hour.

 Sorry, but your children are probably dirty, snotty, germ-infested little monsters. Even after they’ve been potty trained and can shower by themselves, making sure they’re bathed, brushed and groomed is a tedious job. The task is compounded when they get the flu, have the chicken pox or break a bone. Add in doctor visits and kissing boo-boos, and you’re working at the level of a  nurse who would earn $20.43 an hour.
