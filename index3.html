  The glamorous life of a mom who is also the primary housekeeper is filled with picking up dirty socks, sweeping spilled cheerios, vacuuming the dog hair from under the couch, washing the dishes -- all while dodging legos strewn in the carpet. Being responsible for house cleaning and maintenance is a job equivalent to $10.98 an hour as a janitor. But you can’t replace everything a mom does around the house by hiring a Handy cleaner for a few hours (though that would still be a nice idea of a Mother’s Day Gift [link to gift guide]). Mothers don’t just scrub toilets and make the beds, they keep everything in its place.

  Services like Freshdirect and <a href="https://www.blueapron.com/">Blue Apron<a> may have made feeding a family easier, but it’s still a time consuming actiivity. Kids are picky eaters -- one might want peanut butter first then the jelly, another might want crunchy peanut butter not smooth and another might be allergic to peanuts. Keeping tabs on who likes what, who is hungry when and who ate a big snack after school so they aren’t hungry for dinner is a mental sudoku that can’t be replaced with even the most premium meal delivery service. Not to mention quantity -- have you ever seen a growing teenager eat? The actual hours spent cooking are only the last step to being a chef, a job which can earn to $20.01 an hour.

  Michelle Obama may want everyone to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/15/michelle-obama-garden-planting_n_7074040.html">plant a vegetable garden</a>, and sure, it is an educational and fun way to spend an afternoon. But it is also dirty and time consuming. Your preschooler isn’t going to remember to water those carrots. Gardening is a great hobby, but, like anything that requires picking up after pets and regular maintenance, it is also hard work. And work that would pay an average of $11.68.

Despite the washing machine and dryer being there for anyone to use, it often comes down to the mom to take care of laundry. Between separating colors, picking up the dry cleaning, making sure the right soccer uniform is ready for the game a mom must also be on 24/7 stain removal duty. Keeping the family cleaned and pressed is equivalent to $9.77 an hour as a laundry and dry-cleaning lady.

A mother’s economic duties go beyond allowances and budgeting for vacations (remember time last month when you were up to your neck in tax season?). For many women, balancing the books, knowing how much the family can spend on vacations and christmas presents, and taking care of the family’s financial investments are all just another part of the day. However paying for a financial manager would cost $55.44 an hour.

We almost didn’t include this category in this quiz since spending time with your children is a perk of being a mother, not a duty. But if our society is willing to pay babysitters and nannies to hang out with our children, maybe we should be paying mothers the equivalent $9.48 an hour?

Sometimes, especially during those sullen teenage years, children think they’re too cool to tell their parents what they’re up to. It can take 45 minutes for teens to answer “what did you do at school today” in between their constant snapchatting and YikYakking. But just because they aren’t telling you what they’re up to doesn’t mean they’re not telling ask.fm. Sometimes a mom just needs to don her hacker hat and be  private investigator (a job that pays $21.43 an hour, by the way). Just don’t comment on their Facebook posts -- that would be embarrassing!

For eight hours a day your children sit in classrooms learning everything the American educational system can throw at them. And then they come home and ask for your help with a math concept you haven’t thought of since the fourth grade. Being a mom with school-age children means checking homework, tracking grades, meeting with teachers and counselors, spending hours watching <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Kahn Academy</a> videos, editing college application essays, churning through SAT vocabulary flashcards and forcing your kids to go to summer school.

 Sorry but your children are probably dirty, snotty, germ-infested little monsters. Even after they’ve been potty trained and can shower by themselves, making sure they’re bathed, brushed and properly groomed is a tedious job. The task is compounded when they get the flu, have the chicken pox or break a bone. Add in doctor’s visits and kissing boo-boos and you’re working at the level of a  nurse who would earn $20.43 an hour.
